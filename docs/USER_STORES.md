1. As a cook, I want a way to save my recipes, so that I don't have to keep recognizing them again.

2. As a cook, I want to generate a recipe from a picture of food including the ingredients, title, and steps so that I can save time discovering the recipe.

3. As a cook, I want to know what local stores have the ingredients for generated recipes, so I can know where to shop.

4. As a cook, I want to create mobile delivery orders so that I don't have to shop for ingredients myself.

5. As a cook, I want to generate quantities in my local units of measurement so that I don't have to convert units myself.

6. As a cook, I want the system to suggest alternative ingredients so that I can adapt the recipe to dietary preferences.


Technical ideas:
1. Picture recognitions for matching pictures of food with known dishes.
2. Maps/shopping integration so that we can locate local stores that have the ingredients we want.
3. Database for storing recipes
4. Feedback mechanism for users to tell us if a recipe is good or not.
5. I want this to be a web application built on react, nextjs, and tailwind.
